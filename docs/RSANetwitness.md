## About the connector
The RSA NetWitness Platform is an evolved SIEM and threat detection and response solution that allows security teams to rapidly detect and respond to any threat, anywhere. This connector facilitates the automated operations like Get Incident, Get Incidents by Date Range and Get Incident Related Alerts.
<p>This document provides information about the RSA Netwitness SIEM Connector, which facilitates automated interactions, with a RSA Netwitness SIEM server using FortiSOAR&trade; playbooks. Add the RSA Netwitness SIEM Connector as a step in FortiSOAR&trade; playbooks and perform automated operations with RSA Netwitness SIEM.</p>

## Included playbooks
The `Sample - rsa-netwitness-siem - 1.2.0` playbook collection comes bundled with the RSA Netwitness SIEM connector. These playbooks contain steps using which you can perform all supported actions. You can see bundled playbooks in the **Automation** > **Playbooks** section in FortiSOAR&trade; after importing the RSA Netwitness SIEM connector.

- \> RSA Netwitness SIEM > Fetch
- \>> RSA Netwitness SIEM> Fetch Associated events for Incident
- Get Alerts
- Get Hosts List
- Get Incident Related Alerts
- Get Incidents by Date Range
- Get Service IDs
- RSA Netwitness SIEM > Ingest

**Note**: If you are planning to use any of the sample playbooks in your environment, ensure that you clone those playbooks and move them to a different collection since the sample playbook collection gets deleted during connector upgrade and delete.
## Data Ingestion Support
Use the Data Ingestion Wizard to easily ingest data into FortiSOAR&trade; by pulling events/alerts/incidents, based on the requirement.

**TODO:** provide the list of steps to configure the ingestion with the screen shots and limitations if any in this section.

## Data Ingestion Support

Use the Data Ingestion Wizard to easily ingest data into FortiSOAR™ by pulling incidents from RSA Netwitness SIEM. Currently, "incidents" in RSA Netwitness SIEM are mapped to "alerts" in FortiSOAR™. For more information on the Data Ingestion Wizard, see the "Connectors Guide" in the FortiSOAR™ product documentation. 

Configure Data Ingestion
You can configure data ingestion using the “Data Ingestion Wizard” to seamlessly map the incoming RSA Netwitness SIEM "Incidents" to FortiSOAR™ "Alerts".

The Data Ingestion Wizard enables you to configure scheduled pulling of data from RSA Netwitness SIEM into FortiSOAR™. It also lets you pull some sample data from RSA Netwitness SIEM using which you can define the mapping of data between RSA Netwitness SIEM and FortiSOAR™. The mapping of common fields is generally already done by the Data Ingestion Wizard; users mostly require to only map any custom fields that are added to the RSA Netwitness SIEM incidents. 

1.   To begin configuring data ingestion, click Configure Data Ingestion on the RSA Netwitness SIEM connector’s "Configurations" page. 
Click Let’s Start by fetching some data, to open the “Fetch Sample Data” screen.

![](media/start.png)

Sample data is required to create a field mapping between the RSA Netwitness SIEM incident data and FortiSOAR™. The sample data is pulled from connector actions or ingestion playbooks.
2.  On the Fetch Data screen, provide the configurations required to fetch incidents from RSA Netwitness SIEM. You can specify the pull alerts created in past X minutes, associated, and number of alerts to fetch. The fetched data is used to create a mapping between the RSA Netwitness SIEM data and FortiSOAR™ alerts. 

![](media/fetch.png)

Once you have completed specifying the configurations, click Fetch Data.
3.  On the Field Mapping screen, map the fields of a the RSA Netwitness SIEM incident to the fields of an RSA Netwitness SIEM present in FortiSOAR™. To map a field, click the key in the sample data to add the “jinja” value of the field. For example, to map the title parameter of a RSA Netwitness SIEM incident to the Name parameter of a FortiSOAR™ alert, click the Status field and then click the alert Severity field to populate its keys:

For more information on field mapping, see the Data Ingestion chapter in the "Connectors Guide" in the FortiSOAR™ product documentation. Once you have completed mapping fields, click Save Mapping & Continue.
4.  Use the Scheduling screen to configure schedule-based ingestion, i.e., specify the polling frequency to RSA Netwitness SIEM, so that the content gets pulled from RSA Netwitness SIEM integration into FortiSOAR™. On the Scheduling screen, from the Do you want to schedule the ingestion? drop-down list, select Yes. In the “Configure Schedule Settings” section, specify the Cron expression for the schedule. For example, if you want to pull data from RSA Netwitness SIEM every 5 minutes, click Every X Minute, and in the minute box enter */5. This would mean that based on the configuration you have set up, data, i.e., incidents will be pulled from RSA Netwitness SIEM every 5 minutes.


![](media/scheduling.png)

Once you have completed scheduling, click Save Settings & Continue.
5.  The Summary screen displays a summary of the mapping done, and it also contains links to the Ingestion playbooks. Click Done to complete the data ingestion and exit the Data Ingestion Wizard.
